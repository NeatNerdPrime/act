## About ACT

The MITRE Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) framework moves security assessment beyond traditional compliance-focused approaches to a capability-focused, risk-based methodology that provides actionable insights for decision-makers.

### Key Principles

- **Risk-driven** rather than compliance-driven
- **Capability-oriented** rather than control-oriented
- **Multiple risk information sources** beyond just control compliance
- **Understandable and actionable** for leadership decision-making
