# Project Status - MITRE ACT Handbook

## Current Progress (April 25, 2024)

### Image Handling Improvements

1. **Nuxt Image Configuration**:
   - Successfully tested different image provider configurations on Apple Silicon Mac
   - Determined that the 'none' provider works most reliably across platforms
   - Added detailed configuration with comments to guide future developers
   - Created new npm scripts for clean cache restart (`dev:clean` and `dev:clean-log`)

2. **Nuxt Image Components**:
   - Created comprehensive test page for `NuxtImg` and `NuxtPicture` components
   - Verified that these components work correctly with our 'none' provider configuration
   - Successfully replaced standard HTML img tags with `NuxtImg` components in several files
   - Added loading="lazy" for performance optimization

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated DEVELOPMENT.md with detailed image usage best practices
   - Added section about image handling to development documentation
   - Created examples for different image usage patterns in Vue and markdown content

### In-Progress Image Updates

We've begun converting all image instances to use the proper Nuxt Image components:

1. **Files Updated So Far**:
   - `/app/pages/index.vue`: Updated to use `<NuxtImg>` for logo
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/1.introduction/1.index.md`: Updated image to use `<NuxtImg>`
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/2.act-process/1.index.md`: Updated all workflow diagrams to use `<NuxtImg>`
   - `/content/3.blog/8.pentagon-cyber-overhaul.md`: Updated blog images to use `<NuxtImg>`

2. **Files Still Needing Updates**:
   - Remaining handbook content files with images
   - Blog post image usage
   - Development documentation with example images

## Project Configuration Improvements

1. **pnpm Configuration**:
   - Enhanced `.npmrc` file with proper configuration for native modules
   - Added hoisting patterns for Sharp, better-sqlite3, parcel, and Vue
   - Documented configuration approach in DEVELOPMENT.md

2. **Development Scripts**:
   - Added `dev:clean` command for clean cache restart
   - Added `dev:clean-log` command for troubleshooting with logs
   - Updated documentation to reflect new commands

## Previous Accomplishments

1. **Template Robustness**:
   - Applied template robustness patterns to all primary templates (docs, blog)
   - Added conditional rendering, optional chaining, and fallbacks
   - Ensured graceful handling of missing or partial data

2. **ACT Handbook Conversion**:
   - Successfully migrated all handbook content to Nuxt Content format
   - Enhanced content with MDC components (cards, callouts, accordions)
   - Standardized filenames and image references

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive README.md focused on the ACT program
   - Added detailed DEVELOPMENT.md for developer onboarding
   - Added documentation on page structure and components

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Image Updates**:
   - Update remaining files to use `NuxtImg` components
   - Focus on handbook content files first, then blog posts
   - Use consistent approach with wrapper divs for centering/styling
   - Add loading="lazy" attribute for below-the-fold images

2. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Test image rendering across different browsers and devices
   - Verify responsive behavior of images
   - Check for any rendering issues or layout shifts

3. **Document Viewer Component**:
   - Create a DocumentViewer component for embedding PDFs and PPTs
   - Implement iframe-based solution for PDF documents
   - Add loading state and responsive design

## Files to Update

The following files still need image updates to use NuxtImg/NuxtPicture components:

```

# Development Documentation

## Image Usage Best Practices

The recommended approach for images in our project:

```vue
<!-- In Vue Components -->
<NuxtImg 
  src="/images/act-handbook/example.png" 
  alt="Descriptive Text"
  class="max-w-full"
  loading="lazy" <!-- For below-the-fold images -->
/>

<!-- In Markdown Content -->
::div{class="flex justify-center my-6"}
  <NuxtImg 
    src="/images/act-handbook/example.png" 
    alt="Descriptive Text" 
    class="max-w-full"
    loading="lazy"
  />
::
```

This approach provides the best compatibility while following Nuxt best practices.
