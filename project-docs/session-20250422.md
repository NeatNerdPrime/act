# Project Status - MITRE ACT Handbook

## Current Progress (April 22, 2024)

### Image Handling Issues

1. **Root Issue Identified**:

   - Images with spaces in filenames weren't displaying correctly in Nuxt Content
   - First attempted URL encoding and component changes, but encountered inconsistent results
   - Solved by renaming all images to follow web standards (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces)
   - All image files moved to `/public/images/act-handbook/` with proper naming

2. **Image Handling Solution Implemented**:

   - Encountered error with the Sharp image processing library on Mac:

   ```
   [IPX_ERROR] Something went wrong installing the "sharp" module
   Cannot find module '../build/Release/sharp-darwin-arm64v8.node'
   ```

   - This is a known issue with Apple Silicon Macs
   - **Initial approach**: Installing Sharp dependencies (too complex)
     1. Installed vips via Homebrew: `brew install vips`
     2. Installed Sharp module directly: `pnpm add -D sharp`
     3. Used default IPX configuration in nuxt.config.ts
   
   - **Final solution implemented**: Simplified to "none" provider approach
   - Implementation in nuxt.config.ts:

   ```typescript
   image: {
     // Disable image optimization to avoid Sharp/IPX issues
     // This will cause all images to be served directly from their source
     provider: 'none',
     dir: 'public'
   }
   ```

   - Benefits of this approach:
     - Simpler configuration without complex dependencies
     - More reliable across different platforms and hosting services
     - Direct image paths without _ipx prefix
     - Works well with static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify)
     - Relies on pre-optimized images rather than runtime processing
     - Better compatibility with various deployment environments

### ACT Handbook Conversion Status

1. **Completed**:

   - Updated file structure to use proper Nuxt Content organization
   - Created MDC-enhanced content with cards, callouts, accordions, and other components
   - Renamed all image files to follow web standards (lowercase, hyphens)
   - Updated all image references in markdown files
   - Added test page for image usage examples
   - Added utility documentation on MDC components

2. **In Progress**:

   - Resolving image processing issues with IPX/Sharp
   - Testing proper rendering of all MDC components

3. **Files Updated**:
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/1.index.md`
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/1.introduction/1.index.md`
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/1.introduction/2.handbook-purpose.md`
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/1.introduction/3.how-to-use.md`
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/1.introduction/4.framework-overview.md`
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/2.act-process/1.index.md`
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/2.act-process/2.phase-1-planning.md`
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/2.act-process/3.phase-2-assessment.md`
   - `/content/1.docs/2.act-handbook/2.act-process/4.phase-3-reporting.md`
   - `/content/1.docs/3.development/test-image.md`

### Next Steps

1. **✅ IPX/Sharp Issue Fixed**:

   - ✅ Installed system dependencies for proper Sharp support (vips)
   - ✅ Added Sharp module to project dependencies
   - ✅ Updated nuxt.config.ts with optimized image configuration
   - ✅ Ensured consistent image processing in both development and production
   - ✅ Added logging to debug image processing issues
   - Test image rendering across all handbook pages

2. **Content Completion**:

   - Continue enhancing remaining handbook sections with MDC components
   - Complete any unfinished content conversions
   - Ensure all sections use the latest Nuxt UI components properly

3. **Testing**:

   - Test the documentation site with different browsers
   - Test navigation between different handbook sections
   - Verify that all images render correctly
   - Check that accordion, callout, and card components work as expected

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update markdown best practices documentation with lessons learned
   - Add examples of proper image usage in documentation
   - Document the image provider configuration for cross-platform development

5. **Image and Document Enhancements**:
   - ✅ Decided to use standard HTML img tags for simplicity
   - ✅ Using static image paths with the 'none' provider for reliability
   - ✅ Avoided complex lightbox solutions that add complexity to the project
   - Create DocumentViewer component for embedding PDFs and PPTs
   - Implement iframe-based solution for PDF documents
   - Use Microsoft's Office Online viewer for PPT presentations
   - Add loading state and responsive design to the document viewer
   - Test with ACT handbook PDF and PowerPoint files

## Key Learnings

1. **File Naming Best Practices**:

   - Use lowercase letters for all filenames
   - Replace spaces with hyphens (`-`)
   - Keep filenames descriptive but concise
   - Use standard file extensions (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`)
   - Avoid special characters and underscores

2. **Nuxt Content Components**:

   - Use `::callout` with `icon`, `color` and optional `to` properties
   - Use `::card` and `::card-group` for content organization
   - Use `::accordion` with `::accordion-item{label="..."}` for collapsible content
   - Use `::steps{level="3"}` with appropriate heading levels for step-by-step guides
   - Use `::div{class="..."}` for custom styling and layout

3. **Image Handling**:
   - Clean filenames are more reliable than URL encoding
   - 'none' provider is simpler and more reliable than IPX:
     - Avoids complex dependencies like Sharp and vips
     - Works consistently across platforms and environments
     - Doesn't require runtime image processing
     - Resolves _ipx path issues in Vue Router
   - Pre-optimize images rather than relying on runtime optimization
   - Both HTML `<img>` tags and markdown `![]()` syntax work with clean filenames
   - Images can be styled within `::div` containers
   - For documentation sites, simplicity is often better than advanced features

4. **Document Handling**:
   - Custom iframe component most effective for embedding PDFs and PPTs
   - Microsoft Office Online viewer works well for PPT files via iframe
   - Direct iframe links work well for PDF files
   - Consistent naming conventions important for document files too
   - Loading states improve user experience when documents take time to render

## Environment Setup

- Project: MITRE ACT Handbook
- Using Nuxt Content with Nuxt UI Pro (SaaS template)
- Icons: Lucide, Simple-icons, Heroicons, VS Code Icons
- Image handling: Using 'none' provider to avoid IPX/Sharp issues on Apple Silicon
- Logging: Added scripting support for capturing and analyzing logs
  - `pnpm run dev:log` - Runs dev server with logging to timestamped file
  - `pnpm run logs:dir` - Creates logs directory if it doesn't exist
  - `pnpm run logs:clear` - Clears all log files
  - Log files stored in `/logs` directory (git-ignored)
