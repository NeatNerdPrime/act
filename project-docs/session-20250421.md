# Session Progress - Nuxt UI Pro SaaS Template Setup

Last updated: April 21, 2025

## Initial Setup Improvements
- Fixed configuration issues in the Nuxt UI Pro SaaS template
- Added proper theme configuration in app.config.ts
- Adjusted module order in nuxt.config.ts
- Added required theme structure to support Nuxt UI Pro components

## Theme Customization Implementation
- Added UColorModeButton for dark/light mode toggling
- Created a custom SimpleColorPicker component for primary color theme selection
- Implemented a dropdown menu for color selection that appears when clicking the palette icon
- Fixed positioning issues to ensure the dropdown appears within app boundaries

## Current State
- The application now has a working dark/light mode toggle in the header
- Users can change the primary color theme (blue, green, red, purple, orange)
- The color picker uses a clean UI with color labels and visual indicators
- User selections are saved to localStorage to persist across sessions

## Remaining Work
- Continue improving the styling and UX of the theme customization tools
- Consider adding additional customization options (border radius, font size, etc.)
- Ensure consistent behavior across all pages and components

## Technical Notes
- Using native Vue features and refs for DOM manipulation
- Leveraging Nuxt UI components (UButton, UIcon) for consistent styling
- Proper event handling with lifecycle hooks (onMounted, onUnmounted)
- Using computed properties to sync with appConfig for real-time theme changes

## Nuxt Studio Integration
- Added configuration for Nuxt Studio in nuxt.config.ts
- Set up preview API endpoint to enable content editing via Studio
- Ready for import into Nuxt Studio platform for CMS functionality
