# MITRE Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT)

MITRE's Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) implements a comprehensive, flexible, repeatable, and measurable process that enables organizations to meet the objectives of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and other risk-oriented processes.

::alert{type="info"}
ACT can provide the primary input to the Authorization to Operate (ATO) process, superseding compliance-oriented assessments such as the Security Controls Assessment (SCA) process.
::

## Key Advantages

Compared to compliance-oriented assessments, ACT offers several key advantages:

::card
#title
Risk-Driven
#description
Focuses on risk identification and analysis at the capability level rather than technical compliance
::

::card
#title
Capability-Oriented
#description
Emphasizes system capabilities and objectives rather than specific implementation requirements
::

::card
#title
Multiple Data Sources
#description
Considers all available risk data, not just current control compliance status
::

::card
#title
Actionable Insights
#description
Provides context and helps determine what should be done to address identified risks

## Handbook Sections

This handbook is organized into the following main sections:

- [Introduction](/docs/act-handbook/introduction) - Purpose, usage guidance, and framework overview
- [ACT Process](/docs/act-handbook/act-process) - Detailed description of the three phases - Planning, Assessment, and Reporting
- [Attachments](/docs/act-handbook/attachments) - Supporting materials and templates
- [Reference](/docs/act-handbook/reference) - Acronyms, footnotes, and other reference information

## Three-Phase Approach

ACT employs a systematic three-phase methodology to ensure comprehensive security and risk assessment:

::card
#title
Planning
#description
Establish assessment scope, develop methodology, create test plan, and prepare team
::

::card
#title
Assessment
#description
Execute security testing and risk analysis according to the assessment plan
::

::card
#title
Reporting
#description
Document findings, develop actionable recommendations, and present results
::
