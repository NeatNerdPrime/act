# Overview of ACT Framework and Methodology

The Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) framework provides a structured approach to security and risk assessment that emphasizes risk-based decision making.

## Core Principles

ACT is built on several core principles that differentiate it from traditional compliance-oriented assessment approaches:

1. **Risk-Driven Focus**: ACT prioritizes identifying and understanding risks at the capability level rather than focusing solely on technical compliance.

2. **Capability-Oriented**: Instead of focusing on individual controls, ACT considers capabilities - the functional objectives a system must achieve to fulfill its mission.

3. **Multiple Risk Information Sources**: ACT draws from various sources of risk data, not just control compliance.

4. **Actionable Insights**: ACT produces assessments that are more understandable and actionable for decision-makers.

## Assessment Process

The ACT assessment process consists of three main phases:

### Phase 1: Planning

Planning involves understanding the system, defining the assessment scope, and developing a detailed assessment plan. Key activities include:

- Initial discussions with stakeholders
- Review of existing documentation
- Defining the assessment boundary
- Determining testing methodologies
- Creating the assessment plan

### Phase 2: Assessment

The assessment phase involves the actual evaluation of system capabilities and associated risks. This includes:

- Security assessment activities (testing, interviews, documentation review)
- Risk assessment activities (risk identification, analysis, and evaluation)
- Data collection and analysis
- Preliminary findings development

### Phase 3: Reporting

The reporting phase consolidates findings into actionable information. This includes:

- Draft report development
- Stakeholder review
- Report finalization
- Out-briefing to key stakeholders
- Recommendations for risk mitigation

## Key Differentiators

The ACT framework differs from traditional approaches in several important ways:

1. **Focus on Capabilities**: ACT focuses on capabilities rather than individual controls, providing a more holistic view of system security.

2. **Risk-Based Assessment**: ACT emphasizes risk over compliance, helping organizations make better-informed decisions about security investments.

3. **Flexible Implementation**: ACT can be tailored to different organizational contexts and integrated with existing security processes.

4. **Multiple Risk Information Sources**: ACT considers various sources of risk information, providing a more comprehensive assessment.

5. **Clear Communication**: ACT promotes clear communication about security risks to all stakeholders, including technical and non-technical audiences.
