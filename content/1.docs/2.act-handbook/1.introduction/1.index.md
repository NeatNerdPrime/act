# Introduction to ACT

Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) is a security and risk assessment framework that facilitates and encourages risk-based decision-making. ACT implements a comprehensive, flexible, repeatable, and measurable process that enables organizations to meet the objectives of the _NIST Risk Management Framework_ (RMF) and other risk-oriented processes.

ACT can provide the primary input to the Authorization to Operate (ATO) process, superseding compliance-oriented assessments such as the Security Controls Assessment (SCA) process.

## Core Principles

Compared to compliance-oriented assessments (such as SCA), ACT is:

- **Risk-driven** rather than **compliance-driven**: ACT **focuses on risk** identification and analysis at the Capability-level and **de-emphasizes technical findings** and compliance with Controls and other technical requirements.

- **Capability-oriented** rather than **control-oriented**: Capabilities state **objectives** while Controls/requirements state specific **implementation requirements** that _might_ help meet those objectives.

- **Multiple Risk Information Sources**: ACT considers **all available risk data** at the time of the assessment, not just the current state of Control/requirement compliance.

- **Understandable and Actionable**: ACT adds context, brings conversation to a higher level, and focuses on helping the reader **determine what _should_ be done**.

## Key Components

The ACT framework consists of several key components, all of which are explained in detail throughout this handbook:

Capabilities

The functional objectives that a system must achieve to fulfill its mission. Capabilities define what the system should be able to do rather than how it does it.

Risk Information Sources (RIS)

The various sources of data that inform the risk assessment, including security control assessments, penetration tests, vulnerability scans, threat intelligence, and operational data.

Assessment Phases

The ACT methodology is divided into three main phases: Planning, Assessment, and Reporting. Each phase has specific activities and deliverables.

Risk-Based Decision Making

Converting technical findings into actionable insights for leadership by focusing on business impact and mission risk rather than technical vulnerabilities alone.

The ACT methodology provides a structured approach to security and risk assessment while maintaining the flexibility needed to adapt to different organizational contexts and evolving threat landscapes.
