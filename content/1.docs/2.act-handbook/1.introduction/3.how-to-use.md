# How to Use This Handbook

This handbook details the Security Assessment process in detail and notes where there are deviations for the separate Risk Assessment process.

## Assessment Types

There are two main types of assessments covered in this handbook:

1. **Security Assessment**: Focuses on evaluating the security controls and implementation of security measures
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates the level of risk associated with the system and its operations

Usually, if a Security Assessment is being conducted, then a Risk Assessment will also be conducted, in which case the entirety of this Handbook applies. If _only_ a Risk Assessment is being performed, then only certain portions of the Handbook apply.

## For Risk Assessment Only

When conducting a Risk Assessment (either stand-alone or in conjunction with a Security Assessment), the Risk Assessment Lead should focus on the following sections:

* [Introduction](/docs/act-handbook/introduction)

* [Phase 1: Conduct Preliminary Discussion](/docs/act-handbook/act-process/phase-1-planning#conduct-preliminary-discussion)
