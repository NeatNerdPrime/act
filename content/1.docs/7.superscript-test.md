# Typography Enhancement Test Page

This page demonstrates the automatic superscript and subscript rendering capabilities.

## Trademark & Copyright Symbols

### Superscripted Symbols

- ACT™ Framework - using Unicode ™ (should be superscript)
- MITRE® Corporation - using Unicode ® (should be superscript)
- ACT(TM) Framework - using (TM) text → ™ (should be superscript)
- MITRE(R) Corporation - using (R) text → ® (should be superscript)

### Non-Superscripted Symbols

- Copyright © 2025 - using Unicode © (should NOT be superscript)
- Copyright (C) 2025 - using (C) text → © (should NOT be superscript)

## Ordinal Numbers

- 1st place winner
- 2nd runner up
- 3rd place bronze
- 4th quarter results
- 21st century technology
- 42nd annual conference

### Edge Case Ordinals

- 11th hour decision
- 12th grade students
- 13th amendment
- 101st airborne
- 102nd congress
- 103rd district
- 111th meeting
- 112th session
- 113th participant

## Chemical Formulas (Subscript)

Common chemicals automatically rendered with subscripts:

- Water: H2O
- Carbon Dioxide: CO2
- Sulfuric Acid: H2SO4
- Glucose: C6H12O6
- Salt: NaCl
- Calcium Carbonate: CaCO3

### Complex Chemical Formulas

Testing more complex patterns:

- Aluminum Sulfate: Al2(SO4)3
- Ammonium Phosphate: (NH4)3PO4
- Calcium Hydroxide: Ca(OH)2
- Iron(III) Oxide: Fe2O3
- Magnesium Chloride: MgCl2
- Sodium Bicarbonate: NaHCO3
- Potassium Dichromate: K2Cr2O7
- Copper(II) Sulfate Pentahydrate: CuSO4·5H2O
- Ethanol: C2H5OH
- Acetic Acid: CH3COOH
- Benzene: C6H6
- Methane: CH4
- Ammonia: NH3
- Nitric Acid: HNO3
- Phosphoric Acid: H3PO4

## Mathematical Expressions

### Superscript (using ^ notation)

- Area = πr^2
- Einstein's equation: E=mc^2
- Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2
- Polynomial: x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4

### Subscript (using \_ notation)

- Array element: a_1, a_2, a_3
- Chemical notation: X_n where n is the count
- Matrix element: M_11, M_12, M_21, M_22

## Mixed Examples

- The pH of H2O at 25°C is 7.0
- CO2 emissions increased in the 21st century
- The ACT™ framework was developed by MITRE® in the 21st century
- Chemical reaction: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
- The 1st law of thermodynamics: ΔU = Q - W

### Complex Mixed Content

- In the 21st century, CO2 and CH4 are major greenhouse gases
- The 3rd edition of ACT™ includes H2SO4 safety protocols
- MITRE® developed the 1st version using C6H12O6 as a test case
- The 42nd annual conference discussed Al2(SO4)3 applications
- Copyright © 2025 MITRE® - ACT™ 2nd generation with H2O analysis
- The reaction 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O was discovered in the 18th century
- NaHCO3 (baking soda) ranked 3rd in household chemicals
- The 11th sample contained traces of K2Cr2O7
- Fe2O3 forms naturally - discovered in the 19th century
- The 102nd congress passed the Clean Air Act™ regarding SO2 emissions

## Exclusion Testing

<div data-no-superscript>
This section should NOT process: ACT™, H2O, 1st, x^2
</div>

```
Code blocks should not process: ACT™, H2O, CO2, 1st
```

<pre>
Pre-formatted text should not process: H2O, CO2, 1st place
</pre>
