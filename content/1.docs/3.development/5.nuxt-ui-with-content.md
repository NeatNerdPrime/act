# Using Nuxt UI with Nuxt Content

This guide explains how to use Nuxt UI typography components with Nuxt Content's MDC (Markdown Components) syntax.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-document-text" color="primary" to="https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started/typography"}
For the complete, official documentation on Nuxt UI typography components and how to use them in Nuxt Content, visit the Nuxt UI Typography documentation. This comprehensive guide covers all available components, their configuration options, and examples.
::

## Configuration

Make Nuxt UI components globally available in your application by adding the following to your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ... other config
  
  ui: {
    global: true,
    icons: {
      dynamic: true
    }
  }
})
```

With this configuration, all Nuxt UI components are directly available in your markdown files without any imports.

## Built-in Typography Components

Nuxt UI Pro provides a rich set of built-in typography components that you can use directly in your markdown:

### Callouts

Callouts are perfect for highlighting important information:

```md
::callout{icon="i-heroicons-information-circle" color="blue"}
This is a callout with full **markdown** support.
::
```

You can also use shortcuts for different callout types:

```md
::note
This is a note.
::

::tip
This is a tip.
::

::warning
This is a warning.
::

::caution
This is a caution notice.
::
```

### Tabs

Create tabbed content for different code examples or configurations:

```md
::tabs
  ::tab{label="Vue"}
    ```vue
    <template>
      <div>Hello Vue</div>
    </template>
    ```
  ::
  
  ::tab{label="React"}
    ```jsx
    function App() {
      return <div>Hello React</div>;
    }
    ```
  ::
::
```

### Accordion

Create collapsible sections for detailed content:

```md
::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="Section 1"}
  Content for section 1
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Section 2"}
  Content for section 2
  ::
::
```

### Steps

Create step-by-step guides with the steps component:

```md
::steps
  ::step{title="Step 1"}
    Instructions for step 1
  ::
  
  ::step{title="Step 2"}
    Instructions for step 2
  ::
::
```

### Cards

Use the card component for grouping related content:

```md
::card{title="Card Title" icon="i-lucide-users" color="primary"}
Card content goes here.

- Item 1
- Item 2
::
```

You can also group cards together in a grid layout:

```md
::card-group
  ::card{title="Card 1"}
    Content for card 1
  ::
  
  ::card{title="Card 2"}
    Content for card 2
  ::
::
```

### Badges

Add inline badges to highlight features or statuses:

```md
::badge
v3.0.0
::

::badge
Premium
::
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Display keyboard shortcut instructions:

```md
Press ::kbd{value="meta"} + ::kbd{value="K"} to open the command palette.
```

### Steps

Create step-by-step guides using headings:

```md
::steps{level="3"}

### First Step Title
Content for first step

### Second Step Title
Content for second step

### Third Step Title
Content for third step

::
```

Important formatting tips:
- Use blank lines after opening and before closing the steps component
- Use heading tags that match the level specified (e.g., h3 tags when level="3")
- Don't include step numbers in the headings - they are automatically added
- The `level` prop defines which heading level to use (e.g., "3" for h3 tags)

## Best Practices for Components with Icons

When using icons within components, use direct HTML for icons:

```md
::UCard
  **Card Title**
  
  <Icon name="i-heroicons-light-bulb" class="text-lg text-primary-500" />
  
  Card content goes here.
::
```

## Component Naming Conventions

Important note about naming conventions:

1. Built-in typography components use lowercase syntax:
   - `::card` (not `::UCard`)
   - `::callout` (not `::UCallout`)
   - `::tabs` (not `::UTabs`)

2. For component compatibility:
   ✅ **Works Well**: card, callout, badge, tabs, accordion, steps  
   ⚠️ **Use with Caution**: Components with complex nested structures  
   ❌ **Avoid**: Components that rely heavily on props for content (use direct HTML instead)

## Icon Usage

Icons work correctly with the following method:

```md
<Icon name="i-heroicons-light-bulb" class="text-3xl text-yellow-500" />
```

Make sure to:
- Install and configure `@nuxt/icon` module
- Use the format `i-[collection]-[name]` for icon names

## Troubleshooting

If components aren't resolving properly:

1. Restart the Nuxt development server after configuration changes
2. Verify components are globally registered with `ui.global: true`
3. Simplify nested component structures
4. Use direct HTML for icons rather than props
