```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the ACT handbook content in the Nuxt development server to ensure:
   - Navigation works correctly
   - Images display properly
   - Internal links function as expected

2. **Content Review**: Review the content for any formatting issues or missing elements

3. **Final Implementation**: Commit the changes to the repository

4. **Feature Integration**: Consider additional features such as:
   - Search functionality for the handbook content
   - PDF download option for the entire handbook
   - Interactive elements (expandable sections, tooltips for acronyms, etc.)
