## Content Structure

The ACT handbook has been fully converted to Nuxt Content format. The content is organized as follows:

```
content/
  1.docs/
    2.act-handbook/
      1.introduction/
        1.index.md                  # Introduction overview
        2.handbook-purpose.md       # 1.1 Handbook Purpose
        3.how-to-use.md             # 1.2 How to Use This Handbook
        4.framework-overview.md     # 1.3 Overview of ACT Framework and Methodology
      2.act-process/
        1.index.md                  # ACT Process overview
        2.phase-1-planning.md       # 2.1 Phase 1: Planning
        3.phase-2-assessment.md     # 2.2 Phase 2: Assessment
        4.phase-3-reporting.md      # 2.3 Phase 3: Reporting
        5.process-improvement.md    # 2.4 Process Improvement Follow-Up
      3.attachments/
        1.index.md                  # Attachments overview
      4.reference/
        1.index.md                  # Reference overview
        2.acronyms.md               # 4. Acronyms
        3.footnotes.md              # Footnotes
      .navigation.yml               # Navigation configuration for the handbook
    3.development/
      test-image.md                 # Testing file for image usage examples
```

Images from the handbook have been standardized and stored in:

```
public/images/act-handbook/
```

## Current Challenges

1. **Image Processing**: Encountering issues with the Sharp image processing library on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macs

   - Planning to switch from IPX provider to static provider in nuxt.config.ts
   - This will ensure better cross-platform compatibility

2. **Component Rendering**: Some MDC components may have browser-specific rendering issues
   - Especially with accordion and tab components
   - Need comprehensive cross-browser testing

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Image Processing**:

   - Update nuxt.config.ts to use 'static' provider for image handling
   - Test image rendering across all handbook pages

2. **Content Enhancement**:

   - Continue enhancing remaining handbook sections with MDC components
   - Ensure consistent component usage across all pages

3. **Testing**:

   - Test the documentation site with different browsers
   - Test navigation between different handbook sections
   - Verify that all images render correctly
   - Check that interactive components work as expected

4. **Documentation**:

   - Update markdown best practices documentation with lessons learned
   - Document component usage guidelines for future content development

5. **Feature Integration**: Consider additional features such as:
   - Search functionality for the handbook content
   - PDF download option for the entire handbook
   - Interactive elements (expandable sections, tooltips for acronyms, etc.)
